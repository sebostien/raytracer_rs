# Raytracer_rs

A simple [ray tracer][ray_wiki] written in rust.

The code for the ray tracing algorithm is found in [raytracer](./raytracer/).

To specify scenes the program uses a custom DSL parsed by the
crate [scene_parser](./scene_parser/).
Some examples of this are found in the [scenes](./scenes/) folder.

## Usage

The commands:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/raytrace_rs -f scenes/room.scene -r 10 --width 1024 --height 1024
```

Produces the following image:
![Image generated by the program](./scenes/ball.scene)
